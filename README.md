## Overview
We tried to recreate the classic Tank arcade game in real-life. There are two tanks, more affectionately known as ducks due to their form factor, that can be controlled via Bluetooth using the Adafruit Bluefruit Connect App's Controller Pad. Each tank begins with three lives as indicated by three red LEDs near the back. A player can make seven moves: go forward, go back, turn the tank left, turn the tank right, turn the turret left, turn the turret right, and fire. However, a player has a one-second "cooldown" after firing each time, which is a period of time that ignores any Bluetooth command. The game ends when one player reaches zero lives.  
  
Sounds accompanies various game scenarios. There is a sound effect for firing, a ricochet sound effect for when a player gets hit, and an explosion sound effect when a player loses all three lives. The shooting is done using an IR transmitter inside each tank's barrel with an IR receiver mounted to the front of each tank's turret.
